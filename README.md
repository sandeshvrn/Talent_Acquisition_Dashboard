4. Data Source:
The data used for this project is a set of anonymized CSV files representing a fictional recruitment database. The primary tables include candidate profiles, their respective skills, and application details.

5. Features & Highlights:

A)Business Problem.
Hiring managers and HR teams often struggle with a disconnected view of the recruitment process. They lack a centralized tool to track applicant quality, monitor the effectiveness of different sourcing channels, and strategically identify which skills are abundant versus which are critically lacking in their talent pool.

B)Goal of the Dashboard.
To design and build a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard that centralizes recruitment data and provides actionable insights to streamline the hiring process, from initial application to final shortlisting.

C)Dashboard Walkthrough & Key Insights.

Skill Gap Analysis (Quadrant Chart): This powerful visual plots skills based on their market demand vs. the available supply in the candidate pool, segmenting them into four zones:
Healthy Zone (High Demand, High Supply): Key skills that are readily available.
Priority Zone (High Demand, Low Supply): Critical skill gaps that require immediate sourcing attention.
Surplus Zone (Low Demand, High Supply): Skills that are easy to fill.
Low Priority (Low Demand, Low Supply): Niche skills that are not a current focus.
Candidate Segmentation: A decomposition tree allows users to perform root-cause analysis, breaking down the candidate count by industry and skill category to uncover hidden patterns.
